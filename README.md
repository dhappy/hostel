Software for collaborative maintenance and usage of a space.

My initial use case is 665 Riddle Creek on the fourth of July.

Ways I want the software to aid social interactions are:

* The allocation of space
* The coordination of tournaments
* The completion of tasks

Events require some set of tasks to be completed and, potentially, the use of a space.
